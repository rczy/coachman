# Coachman

## TODO:
- confirmation windows for remove actions
- falling emojis when the main "Coachman" button is clicked (very important feature)
- support links in workout descriptions
- workout session page: overview at end
- chart
- use PouchDb or other wrapper for IndexedDB
- splash screen
- slider instead of the progressbar in the carousel
- multi profiles
- (mobile build; capacitor?)
